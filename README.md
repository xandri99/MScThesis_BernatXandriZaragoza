Network Analysis Techniques for Transcriptomics Data in Colorectal Cancer.

The presented methods, described in the MSc Report, are as following:
 - Hierarchical Clustering based approach - Based on standard Hc practice.
 - Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis - Taking the [R-package](https://github.com/cran/WGCNA), [PyWGCNA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/7/btad415/7218311), and the avialble literature as reference.
 - Graph Convolutional Neural Network - ChebNet as per [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), with the inference methods from [this publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33437754/), with some dimensional corrections and adjustments.
