Network Analysis Techniques for Transcriptomics Data in Colorectal Cancer.

The presented methods, described in the MSc Report, are as follows:
 - Hierarchical Clustering based approach - Based on standard Hc practice.
 - Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis - Taking the [R-package](https://github.com/cran/WGCNA), [PyWGCNA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/7/btad415/7218311), and the available literature as references.
 - Graph Convolutional Neural Network - ChebNet as per [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), with the inference methods from [this publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33437754/), with some dimensional corrections and adjustments.


This repository only contains the strictly necessary code to replicate the results presented in the report. For an extended version of this code and more implemented methods, once it can be published, look into the other repository.
